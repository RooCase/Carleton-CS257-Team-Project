This is Team Project A's submissions for Carleton College's CS257 (Software Design) Spring 2022 course. 

The project is a website visualizing the Minnesota Department of Education's COVID response, detailing on a week-by-week basis every public and public-charter school in the state's learning mode (In-person, Hybrid, or fully online) for every grade. We sourced the dataset from the MN department of state, but wrote all of the code to manipulate it, store it in a SQL database, and then display it on the website. We used Flask, psycopg2, and postgreSQL.
